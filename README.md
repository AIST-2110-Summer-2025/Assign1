# Assignment 1: Git'ing Started

This is the README file for the first weekly assignment.

This assignment is quite different from the others. Here we are just getting familiar with GitHub itself. Edits will be made directly to files in the GitHub repository, which normally is not a very good idea. In the future, we will be doing things the "right" way, using a remote (virtual) machine to edit files and then committing and pushing (or syncing) them to the repository.

## Learning Objectives

In this assignment you will:

* Perform some basic setup of your GitHub account

* Learn the basics of editing and markdown

### Task 1: Setup GitHub account and GitHub Classroom

If you are seeing this document it means that you have already done these two parts.

### Task 2: Create a Bio

To get to know you better, write a short bio about yourself. Tell me about who you are, what you love, and what you're looking forward to in this course. 
Include things that let me know a little about who you are, but you don't need to write a book.

Here's what some ideas to include in your bio:

- Your name (required because, as much as I love your fancy GitHub username, I don't actually know who "EpicCoder" is! ðŸ˜‚)
- Your major
- What year you are in (e.g., Sophomore, Junior)
- Where you're from
- What you want to do when you graduate
- What you expect to learn from this course
- A fun fact about yourself
- Personal website or blog, movies/books/series you like... 

#### Steps:

1. Add a New File:
   - Click the `Add file` button located near the top right of the file list in this repository
   - Select `Create new file` from the dropdown menu

2. Name Your File:
   - Enter a name for your new file in the text box that says `Name your file...`
   - Create a file named `bio.md`

3. Edit the Bio:

   Markdown is extremely simple. It's just a text file with VERY basic markup. Much simpler than HTML. For guidance on Markdown, you can refer to the [Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) GitHub Guide for tips.

   Use at least _some_ Markdown formatting (such as *italics*, **bold**, or section headings) to create a brief "bio" about yourself

4. Commit the New File:
   - Click `Commit changes...`.
   - Enter a commit message that describes the file you're adding, e.g., "Added my bio file".
   - Click the `Commit changes` button to save the file to your repository.

#### Note on commit messages

As you work on longer assignments and projects, you should commit and
push regularly. This keeps a "checkpoint" of your work that you can
roll back to if you mess things up, and gives you a backup if
something happens. The problem then is that if
you are doing multiple commits, how are I supposed to know if the
last commit before the assignment deadline was really your final
submission, or if you're still working on it for a late submission? To
solve this problem, *always* use a commit message of the form
"Finished with Assignment" on your assignment submission. If I see
commits before the deadline but nothing with the "Finished" message,
I'll assume you're still working on the assignment and plan to submit
late.

### Task 3: Answer the Questions in the `QUESTIONS.md` file

In this repository you will find a file named `QUESTIONS.md`. Open it and and answer the questions. Click on the pencil button to edit your answers.

Once you finished answering the all questions, make sure to save your changes and commit them using the commit message "Finished with Assignment".
